                    Creative activities involve the inventing and making of new kinds of things.<br></br>
                    If you use something in a creative way, you use it in a new way that produces interesting and unusual results.<br></br>Creativity refers to the invention or origination of any new thing that has value. "New" may refer to the individual creator or the society or domain within which novelty occurs. "Valuable", similarly, may be defined in a variety of ways.
